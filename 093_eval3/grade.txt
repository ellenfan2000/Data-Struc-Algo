Doing some basic checking for your submission

Step 1
Checking that cyoa-step1 compiles
g++ -pedantic -g --std=gnu++98 -Werror -Wall -o cyoa-step1 cyoa-step1.cpp
The code compiled (good)
Executable cyoa-step1 exists (good)
------------------------------------
Now running YOUR tests for step 1
------------------------------------


1.1: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 story1 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Your output looks good. Lets check valgrind
  - Valgrind was clean (no errors, no memory leaks)
Valgrind was clean


1.2: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 story2 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Your output looks good. Lets check valgrind
  - Valgrind was clean (no errors, no memory leaks)
Valgrind was clean
No request to check for intermediate deadline completion on step 1

Step 2
Checking that cyoa-step2 compiles
g++ -pedantic -g --std=gnu++98 -Werror -Wall -o cyoa-step2 cyoa-step2.cpp
The code compiled (good)
Executable cyoa-step2 exists (good)
------------------------------------
Now running YOUR tests for step 2
------------------------------------


2.1: Current test is ./cyoa-step2 story1  <  story1/inputs/input1.txt
-----------------------------
Your output looks good. Lets check valgrind
  - Valgrind was clean (no errors, no memory leaks)
Valgrind was clean


2.2: Current test is ./cyoa-step2 story1  <  story1/inputs/input2.txt
-----------------------------
Your output looks good. Lets check valgrind
  - Valgrind was clean (no errors, no memory leaks)
Valgrind was clean


2.3: Current test is ./cyoa-step2 story1  <  story1/inputs/input3.txt
-----------------------------
Your output looks good. Lets check valgrind
  - Valgrind was clean (no errors, no memory leaks)
Valgrind was clean


2.4: Current test is ./cyoa-step2 story2  <  story2/inputs/input1.txt
-----------------------------
Your output looks good. Lets check valgrind
  - Valgrind was clean (no errors, no memory leaks)
Valgrind was clean
------------------------------------
You have requested that we check for intermediate deadline completion on step 2
------------------------------------
