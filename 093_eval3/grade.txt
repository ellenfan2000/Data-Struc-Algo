Doing some basic checking for your submission

Step 1
Checking that cyoa-step1 compiles
rm -f *~ cyoa-step1 cyoa-step2 cyoa-step3 cyoa-step4
g++ -pedantic -g --std=gnu++98 -Werror -Wall -o cyoa-step1 cyoa-step1.cpp
The code compiled (good)
Executable cyoa-step1 exists (good)
------------------------------------
Now running YOUR tests for step 1
------------------------------------


1.1: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 story1 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Your output looks good. Lets check valgrind
  - Valgrind reported errors
