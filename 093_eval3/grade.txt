Doing some basic checking for your submission

Step 1
Checking that cyoa-step1 compiles
g++ -pedantic -g --std=gnu++98 -Werror -Wall -o cyoa-step1 cyoa-step1.cpp
The code compiled (good)
Executable cyoa-step1 exists (good)
------------------------------------
Now running YOUR tests for step 1
------------------------------------


1.1: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 story1 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Your output looks good. Lets check valgrind
  - Valgrind was clean (no errors, no memory leaks)
Valgrind was clean


1.2: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 story2 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Your output looks good. Lets check valgrind
  - Valgrind was clean (no errors, no memory leaks)
Valgrind was clean
No request to check for intermediate deadline completion on step 1

Step 2
Checking that cyoa-step2 compiles
g++ -pedantic -g --std=gnu++98 -Werror -Wall -o cyoa-step2 cyoa-step2.cpp
The code compiled (good)
Executable cyoa-step2 exists (good)
------------------------------------
Now running YOUR tests for step 2
------------------------------------


2.1: Current test is ./cyoa-step2 story1  <  story1/inputs/input1.txt
-----------------------------
Your output looks good. Lets check valgrind
  - Valgrind was clean (no errors, no memory leaks)
Valgrind was clean


2.2: Current test is ./cyoa-step2 story1  <  story1/inputs/input2.txt
-----------------------------
Your output looks good. Lets check valgrind
  - Valgrind was clean (no errors, no memory leaks)
Valgrind was clean


2.3: Current test is ./cyoa-step2 story1  <  story1/inputs/input3.txt
-----------------------------
Your output looks good. Lets check valgrind
  - Valgrind was clean (no errors, no memory leaks)
Valgrind was clean


2.4: Current test is ./cyoa-step2 story2  <  story2/inputs/input1.txt
-----------------------------
Your output looks good. Lets check valgrind
  - Valgrind was clean (no errors, no memory leaks)
Valgrind was clean
No request to check for intermediate deadline completion on step 2

Step 3
Checking that cyoa-step3 compiles
g++ -pedantic -g --std=gnu++98 -Werror -Wall -o cyoa-step3 cyoa-step3.cpp
The code compiled (good)
Executable cyoa-step3 exists (good)
------------------------------------
Now running YOUR tests for step 3
------------------------------------


3.1: Current test is ./cyoa-step3 story1 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
It looks like you got different output from us on that case.
Here is the diff (yours on left, ours on right):

0(1), 1(2), 3(1), 8(W)					      |	0(1),1(2),3(1),8(win)
0(1), 1(3), 4(2), 12(W)					      |	0(1),1(3),4(2),12(win)
Your file did not match the expected output



3.2: Current test is ./cyoa-step3 story2 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
It looks like you got different output from us on that case.
Here is the diff (yours on left, ours on right):

0(1), 1(2), 5(1), 6(1), 8(1), 11(W)			      |	0(1),1(2),5(1),6(1),8(1),11(win)
0(1), 1(2), 5(2), 7(1), 10(W)				      |	0(1),1(2),5(2),7(1),10(win)
0(2), 2(W)						      |	0(2),2(win)
Your file did not match the expected output

------------------------------------
You have requested that we check for intermediate deadline completion on step 3
------------------------------------

Step 3 EC intermediate deadline test 1
===========================================================
./cyoa-step3 /usr/local/ece551/cyoa/story1
Your output differs from ours.
Below is the diff (yours left/ours right)
0(1), 1(2), 3(1), 8(W)					      |	0(1),1(2),3(1),8(win)
0(1), 1(3), 4(2), 12(W)					      |	0(1),1(3),4(2),12(win)
Your file did not match the expected output

Step 3 EC intermediate deadline test 2
===========================================================
./cyoa-step3 /usr/local/ece551/cyoa/story2
Your output differs from ours.
Below is the diff (yours left/ours right)
0(1), 1(2), 5(1), 6(1), 8(1), 11(W)			      |	0(1),1(2),5(1),6(1),8(1),11(win)
0(1), 1(2), 5(2), 7(1), 10(W)				      |	0(1),1(2),5(2),7(1),10(win)
0(2), 2(W)						      |	0(2),2(win)
Your file did not match the expected output

Step 4
Checking that cyoa-step4 compiles
The code did not compile!
